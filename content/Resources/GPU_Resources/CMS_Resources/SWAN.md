# SWAN
## Preparation

1. Registration:
    To require GPU resources for SWAN: According to [this thread](https://swan-community.web.cern.ch/t/gpu-support-in-swan/108), one can create a ticket through [this link](https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal?id=functional_element&name=swan) to ask for GPU support at SWAN, it is now in beta version and limited to a small scale.
2. Setup SWAN with GPU resources.
    1. Once the registration is done, one can login [SWAN with Kerberes8 support](https://swan-k8s.cern.ch/) and then create his SWAN environment.

        ðŸ’¡ Note. When configuring SWAN environment, one should carefully choose the software stack he want to use. Not only one should choose to use the releases with GPU Support, but also she/he should keep the CUDA version in mind. Once additional software installation is needed, it must be configured to use the version compatible with current CUDA version.

Another important aspects is the environment script, which will be discussed later in this document.

1. After setting up the SWAN environment, one will browse the SWAN main directory `My Project` where all existing projects are displayed. A new project can be created by clicking the upper right "+" button. After creation one will be redirected to the new created project, whose "+" button at upper right panel can be used for creating new **notebook**.

2. Also it is possible to use the terminal for installing new packages or monitoring computational resources. 
    1. For package installation, one can install packages with package management tools, e.g. `pip` for `python`. To use the installed package, one need to wrap environment configuration into a script and let SWAN to execute. Detailed documentation can be found by clicking the upper right "?" button.
    2. To monitor the computational resources, in addition to ordinary CPU resources `top` and `htop` , you can also use the `nvidia-smi` to monitor GPU usage.

## Examples 

After installing package, you can then use GPU based machine learning algorithms. Two examples are supplied as an example.

> 1). The first example aims at using a CNN to perform handwritten digits classification with `MNIST` dataset. The whole notebook can be found at [PytorchMNIST](Notebooks/PytorchMNIST.md). This example is modified from [an official `pytorch` example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist).
> 2). The second example is modified from the simple MLP example from [`weaver-benchmark`](https://github.com/colizz/weaver-benchmark). The whole notebook can be found at [TopTaggingMLP](Notebooks/TopTaggingMLP.md).
